about the killer dressed as the punisher: frank never hid his face  under a hood. a mask once in season one of his show when he infiltrated the military base, but that&#39;s it. so wearing  a hood, shooting point blank in the head from the side is very un-frank like
please do invincible next üôè
that was my first thought the dialogues were incredible got me so engaged that i forgot i was watching a tv show
peak court scenes... remember the times we had she hulk?
black panther<br>white tiger<br><br>both superheroes have colour and feline in their names and both actors playing those characters dies due to same disease. . .<br><br>it&#39;s really heartbreaking üíî...<br><br>may the demised soul rip . . .
just finish watching ep3 and went right to your video
you missed the name drop of miles morales father officer morales.
frank castle kills are face to face. he barely ever hides himself (until that is tactically advantageous)
was waiting for your breakdown, but i was really hoping for you to speak about the name matt mentioned in the court &#39;officer morales&#39; like they mentioned spiderman earlier in the first episode too.
nice recap, thank you!
in dare devil born again episode 3 there&#39;s is name of officer morales it could be an easter egg for miles morales spiderman
yessss perfect video to wstch while eaiting üòÅ
you give the absolute best break-downs, thank you for this.
i still don&#39;t know how marvel got this good. this is very good..!!!
when he reads the list of police officers, one of them is officer morales. it is probably the father of miles morales.
the idea of revealing the identity is so moronic...matt should be called moron devil instead of dare devil
you missed the officer morales reference üòÖ
this episode made me feel like i was actually watching a real life trial and was rooting for him to be found not guilty lol
i think you missed this part where fisk and vannessa were on the dinning table. at the ending part, the camera zoomed in on fisk&#39;s fist having bruises with blood. could be that he finally went to beat up vannessa&#39;s ex
anyone else notice when matt&#39;s listing the names of officers who testified in court for the white tiger, he mentions &#39;officer morales&#39; ? i believe this may be a nod to miles morales&#39; father
episode 3 as a fan, a adult and a boricua completly emotionly destroyed me. this show is on another level. i absolutly love it. one of the best shows to come out of marvel studios.
you need a narrator because some things you say (like the name of the painting, the ladys name and consequently the name of her business) aren&#39;t understandable at all.
actually, in the courtroom scene where the officers are there, mat calls out officer morales. now this could be a random police officer. or it could be a subtle hint/refrence to miles morales in the mcu.
matt fiddling with the broken horn made me think of how catholics have the prayer beads they run. fitting since he sees the court room as a sort of church
dude, matt mentioned police reports about white tiger&#39;s help to the public in court. one of the reports was from morales (miles morales&#39; dad).
this is sooo well written and so tense to watch and it barely has any action
the sound of that tree frog playing during the credits really hits hard.
i love everything within and aorund the show especially the one who does breakdowns ‚ù§
not a single action seen in this episode, bit disappointed
that scene where matt raises hector&#39;s mask reminded me of that issue cover of peter telling his secret identity to m.j. in ultimate spider-man.
when daredevil reads the name of the police men who were saved by white tiger. one of the names involved. morales. this might indicate that miles morales father is a police officer of the nypd, and miles might be existing in this universe
it just shows, that matt is really good lawyer and she-hulk isnt :d
did no one noticed &quot;officer morales&quot; name when matt was talking about good deeds of white tiger? it&#39;s miles morales father. maybe spiderman miles morales in coming to mcu?‚úåÔ∏è
marvel should realize recasting is not bad, i get the feeling they just killed off white tiger because the original actor died, same thing they did to black panther. but there is yet hope because they didn&#39;t kill off thadeus ross and recasted him
everyone knows it wasn&#39;t actually punisher at the end lol.
nicky torres was the biggest let down
but doesnt the white tiger amulett give him healing powers too ??
why matt can&#39;t go to an actual church now ??
u can tell its not the real punisher (jon bernthal) just by the way jon walks
small island but we are everywhere, so much pride. then we got officer moralesüëÄ
don&#39;t forget the officer morales name drop üòÅü§ò could be getting miles in the next spider-man!
if canadian lad uploads early, u know he likes the movie/showüòâ
hope kamar de los reyes gets to come back into the multiverse. really great actor
in one moment in courtroom mat says &quot;officer moralles&quot;...could that be father of miles moralles, or just coincidenceü§î
i&#39;m sure kamar de los reyes could have been as big as other superheroes. he was perfect as hector ayala/white tiger.<br>r.i.p
this show i think is reviving my love for good shows and great writing, it really is a refreshing breath of air, i think it‚Äôs going to get me to rewatch daredevil and punisher to really dial back in to this amazing world they‚Äôve set up!
i honestly likes this character a lot the actor the character the superhero all 3 of them were perfect sad that cancer took him out irl and im betting if he didnt have cancer they probably wouldve left him alive in the show the actor was in pain while filming which makes his last role more inpactful
hey canadian lad , matt present the proof of the officers who wrote cases praising white tiger where he tells officer morales , is it pointing to miles morales dad ?
i&#39;m surprised he didn&#39;t mention the morales reference
victims: then from nowhere white tiger came and save me.<br>meanwhile white tiger : getting shot by someone easily.
but in court i think the defender gets the final argument unless they wave it. but i&#39;m not sure.
moonknight would cross-over really well into this series üòî
radha radha radha radha.
non of you guys notice when officer morales name was mentioned?
you missed a miles morales references
ice cube was right about cops
when matt outed hector as white tiger i lost it! i was yelling at him in outrage as if i was in the court room and he could hear me! üòÇ and at the end even though i saw it coming it still hit sooo hard! üò¢ rest peacefully my brother may you listen to the coqui irl, you knocked it out of the park!
am i fan of daredevil? no<br><br><br>am i a fan of this series? yes!
u forgot to mention that as the credits rolled in, we hear the sound of the coqui and waves crashing, this is what hector thought about during the opening scene of the episode. this could also insinuate that even though hector life is cut short, he will still be in paradise. this is even sadder in context of the real life actor passing away, it could also be a nod to him being in paradise too
this epi was full of blunders
this was a great episode with a great reaction
you become overly glazing
who ever expected the spider-man cameo when the scene is about to increase the intense on the victim.<br><br>i thought spidey will come for saving victim and brings him to court
missed detail -<br>while telling everyone in the court how hector helped many people, he shows some police reports too. one of the police officer is officer morales. miles&#39;s father from a different universe. <br>i hope you see this comment, love from india.
during the credits, you can hear the bird sound ayala was talking about in prison with matt.
i jumped out of my bed when i saw hector got shot and dropped my ipad when it showed punishers symbol and i was like there‚Äôs no way. i was shaking. i didn‚Äôt thought that they will just end white tiger in the same episode where he was proven not guilty. but hats off to him for this amazing performance with the limited time he had.
when matt murdock gives out the police report about white tiger, he mentions mr morales. crazy that miles morales getting mentiond, maybe he will get introduce in the near future? btw am a big fan of your!!
fast?
there was a little ester egg in one of the police reports that mat says one of the officers name was morales
that was lazy writing to me the way they killed white tiger off
rip to the og cordis die
i predict that fisk &amp; vanessa will have a falling out. she was always more interested in his power than him. even in s03 there was so much distance. also at the gangster meeting the guy says &quot;i don&#39;t work for the mayor, i work for the man&quot; and the gangsters look changes. she commands more fear &amp; respect than fisk now. they were willing to go against fisk but not her. you missed this.
did you notice that kingpin&#39;s suit is getting lighter?
this is effin awesome courtroom drama. acting, writing, music.
anybody else keep replaying the end credits until the coqui soothed you out of the sadness?<br>just me?
a fun detail with the tattoos is that it&#39;a a huge lead for matt to follow, but of course.. he has no idea they exist.
just like black panther , we lost white tiger. ah
i don‚Äôt think you know how confidentiality works with therapists. they can‚Äôt just tell the cops about criminal behavior or activity unless it involves child/elder abuse or somebody being in imminent danger. they can‚Äôt just report criminal behavior lol. even past crimes
i&#39;d like to think daniel and sheila is fisk&#39;s moral compass in this series. might be too obvious but its a nice detail.
man this has too many spoilers, from beyond the spoilers. like revealing all the things that happen in the comics in the &#39;future&#39; of the storyline. that&#39;s just lame. dislike
surely i&#39;m not the only one that expected the ending, even more so - sooner in the episode?!
also during the courtroom seen where matt lists the testimonies of other police officers, officer morales is mentioned
has anybody noticed the ending background music? it was the same frog sound and the beach water which made us kinda more emotional when it plays after hector&#39;s death.
me at the beginning of the episode: i can&#39;t wait how they play white tiger here.<br><br>me at the end of the episode: oh...
rip legend. üò¢‚ù§
kingpin is the best villain in awhile.
i thought the frogs &quot;singing&quot; during  the credits was a really good touch. gave me chills.
the writting just keeps on getting better and better. i love the symbolism more than anything in the show, it just hits differently. brilliant writting it is.
this episode reminded me of &quot;the boys&quot; in the sense that with hector being proven innocent only to be shot down unceremoniously by the end üò¢
can you try and connect yellow suit daredevil in she hulk and this current daredevil in the timeline since both are mcu?
blur more, i got spoiled. thx canada
officer morales was also mentioned at the trial! i&#39;m deeply convinced that this was a small hint! about miles morales :) we might see officer morales in this series! but if not, i&#39;m sure he&#39;ll definitely appear in the next spider-man installment!
i don&#39;t know if you noticed yet but the negative of punisher&#39;s teeth in muse&#39;s graffiti looks like the statue of libery
while there matt was reading the police report to the jury i heard the name officer molares, couldn&#39;t it be a direct reference to miles molares dad
i never thought white tiger gone like that‚Ä¶.. may he rest in peace
does the lady liberty on the &#39;triggered&#39; punisher graffiti mean anything?
canadian lad, the suit being too big on him could also be from his past, since drug addicts can lose a lot of weight maybe it was just an old relic of who he used to be
i&#39;m not sure if you said you were, but would you be able to do a .25x breakdown on &quot;your friendly neighborhood spider-man&quot; the new show on disney +
rest in peace menendez ‚ù§‚ù§üñ§
the police witnesses for white tiger also includes officer morales, so does this confirm that miles also exists. did anyone else noticed it?
killing off a character this way right after introducing him, and most of all, embellishing him, is pretty cheap, and raises the obligatory question about why the hell isn&#39;t kingpin killing daredevil the same way.<br>maybe the did it because the actor died, because otherwise, it&#39;s just cheap and terrible.
but isnt hochberg&#39;s closing statement more self serving? majority of his words like going church kissing kids and all that are stuff every person does it because its a normal thing to do. but saving someone while putting your lives on the line several times is another thing. sure you have served a great people but how many times did you have to put your life on the line as a gamble to do that? 0. i mean its my pov that his had major flaws you could find out if you find logic in that...
imo the thing that makes she-hulk court scene didn&#39;t hit the mark is the tone they&#39;re going for. like we so used to the court room drama so serious like this one, while she-hulk tried to make it more into a comedy. like bringing madyson and the shape shifting case.
why i don&#39;t think it was frank:<br>1. not punisher&#39;s style<br>2. not much of a motive<br>3. if he knew he was let free, he would also know that matt is his lawyer. he would be able to trust or at least know what matt is doing. he would know that matt knows he&#39;s innocent.
it was like they knew he was gonna die in real life.
i hope they show punisher killing those corrupt popo. i love matt but im kinda fed up with his not killing bad guys policy when the city he&#39;s in is full of corrupt, killers, and all kinds of garbage in the society. people really need the punisher. his methods maybe some kinda inhumane but he is necessary. hope the show kills king pin in this season so we can move on to another problem/bad guy. that  bald fat guy is getting redundant while white tiger&#39;s deed hasn&#39;t highlighted enough. his death is shocking but im not that attached to him since they didn&#39;t show his good deeds enough. i hope they don&#39;t follow dc&#39;s style of always bringing back the old foe in the series. it gets boring in the long run.
thanks lad!!
only of the best dd episodes ever
that aint frank bro. if he really intended to kill him he would have done that from a 1000 yards afar. with a sniper...
well done breakdown, that episode tore at my heart which is still mending... thanks for placing white tiger as the thumbnail!
6 more episodes left and i already think that daredevil born again is the best disney+ show ever.
did you catch the noises while the credits where rolling? go back and listen!
there&#39;s a set photos of couple of corrupt cops and one of them is the piece of sh*t who killed hector, he donned the same vest model and &quot;punisher&quot; logo.
i&#39;m sorry, but isn&#39;t that the same guy that played menendez in black ops 2
wayne resorts? like bruce wayne???
and also, at minute 30.35 in the series, matt mentions the name &#39;officer morales&#39; which could be additional evidence that miles morales and his family also exist in the mcu. (of course i knew aaron davis had been around since homecoming, but with matt mentioning morales, this might just add to the evidence)
rest in peace kamarüïäüëëüïä
mcu shill
this is the best breakdown of the episode<br>as we&#39;ve been waiting for it for ages, a full analysis of  episodes is much needed here
there&#39;s another detail : hector ayla talks about the beach and the frogs and matt promises that he&#39;ll see em again. but when hector died, the credits came and that had the sound of the beach waves and the frogs, which he never got to see. and that pulled on the heart strings for me üò≠
dont know if you noticed this but when there reading the police reports there is one from officer morales not sure if its just a coincedence tho
i think this is the best episode of daredevil, why ? <br><br>as mention before, we can see matt as lawyer praying and hoping for justice<br><br>his struggle faced between returning as daredevil or continuing to hope that the law will continue to be fair<br><br>we can see emotional scene where matt defend hector, this scene i think make me know why matt always says that he is a good lawyer<br><br>one of who kill hector maybe were the bad cop, by killing him using punisher suit, it will trigger matt to confront punisher and toto slander the punisher as the one who killed hector
that&#39;s obviously not frank who shot white tiger. frank is neither a hitman nor a contract killer, and he sure wouldn&#39;t do a job for kingpin. my guess is it was really powell (who has punisher tattoos). when frank finds out he&#39;s being set up, though...boy, is he gonna be pissed. üòÄ
it‚Äôs elaine wynn ex mr. wynn‚Äôs wife. they used to owned wynn resorts
the coquis at the end of the episode actually had me tearing up
it was perfect. perfect. everything, down to the last minute details
how did you miss <b>officer morales&#39; file on white tiger</b>
why didn&#39;t they try to prove that it was an accident. they were constantly saying that he was a cop murderer.  nobody tries to prove that he never pushed the cop and that it was the cops mistake that he fell.
the sister becomes the next white tiger. it&#39;s the amulet that gives the power of the tiger god. the shooter left it around hector&#39;s neck.
well done
the court scene was so good both matt‚Äôs closing and hoch‚Äôs closing was so good, i was genuinely at the edge of the seat when the jury was reading hector‚Äôs verdict.
the reason why i love this show is because i admit not watching the netflix versions of these characters but i still can understand the whole lore. now they are in the bigger mcu, all legal dramas and ethical dilemmas of heroism, anti-heroism, and vigilantism can make so much sense
shame we will not see hector again as the white tiger. it&#39;s obvious it wasn&#39;t frank who killed him.
there&#39;s something to do with red hook, foggy was on about it in the first episode, so was vanessa when she had the meeting and then in this episode. something will lead to red hook and i got a feeling it might be a big twist, maybe foggy faked his death or maybe the person who ordered his death will be found at that location because of bullseye, trailer footage confirmed seeing him again. (possibly a flashback or a moment in the present)
i don&#39;t think the punisher shirt actually exists in the scene, it&#39;s just symbolism of how vigilantes can be both innocent and guilty.
do not forget that coqui sounds in the credits ü•∫ in my opinion it&#39;s for the actor&#39;s passing away more than the character he played üïäÔ∏è
do the penguin series breakdown
i knew he was gonna die when i saw him wearing the suit at the end. what was he even thinking to wander like that just after that big of a case.
its not your usual content but there&#39;s a movie called heretic with some great cinematography and attention to detail that i believe needs your breakdown. please and thank you.
god bless you man
they cast a goated actor and wasted him in one episode
cordis die
in the court room scene matt took names of some police officers out of which one name particularly stands out officer. morales, i can&#39;t help but wonder if this is a reference to miles morales father ?
it was officer powell that shoots white tiger.. his vengeance would never allow anyone else to pull the trigger.!
the triggered punisher art has the statue of liberty in between the center teeth
i liked it but spoiler alert!<br><br><br><br><br>i really though they fked up again when punisher killed white tiger, but it wasn&#39;t him so it&#39;s fine.
by killing the white tiger (hector ayala) in dare devil is marvel opening the opportunity to bring white tiger (ava ayala) live action and what if she team up with spider man like in the ultimate spiderman?
daredevil born again ep3 &gt; all the court room scenes in she hulk
this show is such a downgrade since the masterpiece we got from netflix
i really liked this episode. can&#39;t wait see the next one on 19th
why would you assume that i want you to spoil the source matereal for the show that is adapting that matereal buddy?<br>warning next time.
every scene with the broken horn is from re-shoots‚Ä¶ mmw
dude, the episode&#39;s ending and credits were so impactful<br>i was hoping to get some white tiger action scene, but the way it went got me by surprise in such a sad way<br>rip kamar de los reyes
while talking about police reports , matt murdock reads a police report by inspector morales a subtle nod to miles morales dad.
i hate this weekly release as much now as i did as a kid üò≠üò≠ü§£
ep 3
this court room scene was so intense that i was thrilled it was better then she hulk she cases where more comedy that&#39;s and not enough stake that&#39;s why they where boring
its shows like law and order that make court drama cliche. when i first started watching daredevil because of its association with marvel comic i then began to take interest in law and order. because of this super hero show it has since inspire me to take law as profession so with a few more years of college left im hoping that it could be possible for me.
i also love the detail that matt wears wristwatch that uses magnetic ball rather than indexes behind glass do he could feel the time. works great with his blind cooking acting
you can also note that in the starting scene when mat is talking to ayala about vigilantism- he in a way convinces himself that being a lawyer is a reasonable alternate than being a vigilante.
i don&#39;t understand why people are complaining about this episode where we do not have any action or fight scenes.<br>that was not required at all.<br>daredevil court scenes in netflix also move the story ahead in the right direction.<br>this season is delivering it&#39;s promise so farüôèüëç
awesome üòéüòÆ
i love how the shows not afraid to kill characters that people love just a thought
rip kamar de los reyes.
yo that was quick ‚ù§<br>a whole courtroom drama episode, yet i wasn&#39;t bored a second. tbf it&#39;s exactly my cup of tea üòÇ but that&#39;s why i can say with confidence it was a brilliant episode.<br>lad, i can literally hear you&#39;re exited for this üòä maybe i&#39;m crazy but i even feel like you&#39;re talking a little bit faster than usual. i get u man... the mcu might be back on track
missed one detail. opposition lawyer says the name officer morales. coincidence?
little easter egg about miles morales, in the courtroom scene matt was presenting some records of officers who reported about white tiger, one of them was from officer morales
the entire episode i kept expecting things to happen and they never did. then it ended with something i really didn&#39;t think was going to happen, maybe something would happen, but not like that.<br><br>loved this episode though, the courtroom episodes in daredevil have always been some of the best.
i was really disappointed with the way they ended the episode and i hope that this character matters in the future or else this episode feels pointless and maybe even disrespectful
after a long time waiting for next episode has become hard
this show....wow.  guess the amulet doesn&#39;t make you bullet proof.  üò¢
i am pretty sure that gideon mace is the one who killed hector just like the comics
office morales was  mentioned  by matt murdock
ending had me punching the air üò¢üò¢
officer morales mentioned by matt in courtroom scene
rest in peace kamar  de los reyes
i can tell canadian lad is happy to finally talk about good shows . marvel really stressed canadian lad over the past couole of years üòÖ
best marvel series along with loki and moon knight
maybe they are taking a page from the real world, a convicted felon to mayor,governor,or. president.
where is penguin breakdown?
frank castle is going to be soooooo mad when he catches wind of police using his symbol wrong. i‚Äôm really excited and scared for what‚Äôs going to happen to them.
the white tiger was an older man, so there is a chance that a younger family member could use the amulet and take up the title of white tiger.
so hector ayala‚Äôs death motivates his nephew to take up the mantle of white tiger and could later join young avengers with the help of mismarvel. i guessüò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è
it felt like the entire courtroom scene white tiger, represented daredevil, and indirectly matt was providing reasons for why daredevil should be brought back. every reason why white tiger was justifying his reason to keep going after his identity was exposed it felt like matt was talking to his inner self that wants to be daredevil again. the character witness and police reports white tiger had daredevil had just as many also. white tigers entire court seen was an allegory for why matt should put the suit on again.
fisk would not kill hector, that&#39;ll make his stand against vigilantes more complicated
except theres a huge issue here. now hes outed as a vigilante, wich means hes going to be punished fora billion other crimes. he aint leaving jail realistically by the laws of the mcu in that period..
matt&#39; s move of revealing the identity  of the white tiger was not  brilliant.
it&#39;s sad that the actor who played white tiger past. it&#39;s also sad that this show was made all the way back in 2023. and we had to wait till 2025 just to watch it. and we have to wait a whole week just to watch another episode. why can&#39;t they just release the whole season? let people binge watch it and for those who don&#39;t want to binge it can wait. üòÇüòÇ
i can‚Äôt be the only one that knows matt wouldn‚Äôt have exposed hector like that in the court room.
did they killed white tiger because the actor died or<br>it was the plan all along?
marvel is known for their banger episode 4s.... the best is maybe yet to come
the &quot;triggered&quot; sign on a punisher logo, means that punisher will not tolerate even the dirty cops, and he will come to the show. ps: matt is a coplete moron in this series. he know exactly, why he can&#39;t reveal white tiger identity, and he just reveal it anyway.
one single detail u actually missed is his watch <br>he uses brailed  watch that tells him time <br>not a mentionable detail but a very cool one
daredevil revealing white tiger&#39;s identity is the stupidest thing i&#39;ve ever seen. all white tiger&#39;s enemies are gonna kill his family. how matt didn&#39;t realise that. that&#39;s just stupid writing
may kamar de los reyes&#39;s soul rest in peace. his performance was beyond perfect. he was gone too soon. may god bless his soul and his family
episodes too short the only downfall of this series so far
that koki sound at credits hit hard
miles morales&#39; dad is mentioned during the police report scene.
bro get that spoiler out of the thumbnail!
this show so far has been a much needed breath of fresh air. this episode in particular. no big time fight scenes or cgi spectacles. just top tier writing, directing, and acting.
hector got himself killed.  matt told him he would be okay if he followed his orders.  hector didn&#39;t.
i didn&#39;t hate she-hulk, but it was very obvious that the writers didn&#39;t know anything about lawyer series. born again did everything right in 2 episodes. the accused is interesting, he has a weight in the story, he puts the protagonist in conflict, there are good performances, there are plot twists and tension at all times. i understand that the tone of both series is different, but let&#39;s say it, that&#39;s how it&#39;s done.
bro&#39;s faster than lightning mcqueen this time üòÇ
this episode really did bring me back to the old netflix show days with realistic brutality
man kamar&#39;s performance and what happened to him made everything so emotional üò¢
i know we&#39;re only 3 episodes in, but born again is hitting the right note where most mcu shows have failed, including the good ones.<br>it doesn&#39;t feel like a 6-part movie. it&#39;s very well written and acted, has an interesting villain, good cinematography, music, and sound. it feels like it&#39;s tapping into its potential while holding its best cards close to its chest, like frank, karen, and muse, etc.<br>daredevil is moving in the right direction, and judging by the early reviews, it&#39;s clear the best is yet to come.
this episode proved that daredevil: born again is not just about action and brutality. it was so good, and a perfect reminder that matt is not only a good fighter but also a very good lawyer! slow episodes like this in other shows are usually boring, just to give some break before another battle. here it was brilliant, emotional and interesting with unexpected twists. it&#39;s like the roots of the original netflix show, i fully feel like this is the continuation that i was waiting for.
under i hour ‚¨áÔ∏è
is officer morales a dirty cop?
also in this episode matt mentions on of the police is morales.....and i waiting for miles entry to mcu in upcoming projects
i don&#39;t care how many breakdown channels are out there, you are my favorite.
the credits are silent for a few seconds before the whistling frogs that white tiger is describing kicks in and its pretty heartbreaking
does frank ever use hoodie. whoever that person was, still looking promising. the height, way to use guns. i thought they broke out bullseye out of prison. fisk is mayor, he knows poindexter.
white tiger actor could have fit in role of wolverine   variant   but rest in peace
two people died in 3 episodes they not backing off üòÇ
today&#39;s a great day! got the finale for season 3 of invincible and a new upload! for the daredevil episode üòÉ whoo hoo!
one amazing fact about the episode is the ending music<br>literally beach sounds‚ú®
as someone who read the comics, i was expecting this but man i didn&#39;t expect to hit me like a ton of bricks. rest in peace kamar de los reyes üôè. your final performance as hector ayala will always be remembered and cherished. we won&#39;t forget you brother üò≠.<br><br><br>i really hope we get ava ayala&#39;s white tiger in the mcu. just think about it; spiderman, daredevil, punisher, white tiger, luke cage, elektra, iron fist, moonknight, jessica jones, maya lopez&#39;s echo and misty knight all teaming up to defeat kingpin and saving new york. man, i can&#39;t wait for it üî•. hands down, this will be a dream come true for all marvel fans üôå .
for gamers- kamar de los reyes (white tiger) also played the iconic raul menendez in cod black ops 2
the end credits of this episode man &lt;3
so, white tiger died without the audience seeing him even fight once.<br><br>ok.
i hope the white tiger returns in some part of the mcu, i haven&#39;t read much of the comics, so this is the first i&#39;m hearing on the white tiger and it sounds really interesting
i pray that kamar is happily looking down on us all appreciating his work! this episode definitely delivered!
am i the only one who thinks the background music is a bit offf??
both white tiger character and actor die too soon..really wanted to see him in action..<br><br>rip brother
absolutely loved this episode, don‚Äôt care what the critics say. this episode  was just beautiful and interesting
in the courtroom scene where matt is showing the police reports of how white tiger helped the cops, he mentions a &#39;officer morales&#39;, could be a coincidence or could be an easter egg to miles morales
rip to kamar de los reyes.<br><br>i&#39;ve noticed that this ep brought a lot of doubters back into the series because of how similar it was to the og show &amp; i love that. need frank to pull up on these grifter cops.
here‚Äôs another detail from the courtroom:<br><br>when matt was using police reports to help his case, one of the names he dropped was officer morales, alluding to the father of miles morales and making this the second nod to spider-man in this series
we really got one of the best episodes in a superhero series possibly top 3 talking about peakvincible ofc
i already think this season is better then daredevil season two
you should hear the credit score in that episode‚Ä¶ just do it and you will know
it would have been so easy to have the punisher impersonator fire from the shadows, revealing himself and walking out after firing, because stepping out of the shadows to approach white tiger with his amulet on should have invariably alerted white tiger with his heightened senses. in anticipation of this, the gunman not only baits him with the scream but gets into position before he arrives so he avoids moving. i wish they would‚Äôve did this.
bro you missed the reference of &quot; officer morales &quot; by matt when he is showing the reports of police to the judge .
rest in peace kamar de los reyes &quot;the white tiger&quot;ü§ç
good episode. however it would be better if wilson wasn&#39;t a cuckold
that&#39;s why lad is the best in breakdown game
i think the cops is a fanboy of punisher
rip kamar de los reyes.<br><br>btw , can u make content on invincible. the finale dropped today and i think it&#39;s one of the best superhero stuff ever.
‚Äúmartyr me‚Ä¶ for cordis die‚Äù
that courtroom scene actually scared me
i wish marvel includes characters like white tiger, ferral(mutant), tigra in such series because most of the millennial/gen-z kids don&#39;t know how amazing some of the other less known characters in marvel could be!! <br><br>(not dissing gen-z or millennials)
amazing episode. in the era of oversaturated comedy action cbms and shows, this episode without any action stands out.
men see this, men click on this, men happy‚ù§
i really enjoyed the performance of the white tiger by the late kamar de los reyes. i only just found out that he passed away so sad. this episode was great. good courtroom drama and i like the pacing so far. the season is slowly building its momentum one episode at a time but i dig it. vincent d&#39;onofrio is killing it as kingpin.
bro the marvel has taken their series to another level
for me as as a person with the visual impairment if you watch. matt, cooking dinner was amazing. that is everything that a person who is totally blind or who has a visual impairment will do
the white tiger mantle will live onüêØ
bro is fast
the fact that the man who played hector ayala died in real life is so depressing! he was a great actor.. rip
mindblowing episode
out of this world?!üíîüòÇ
under 7 minsüôåüôå
that was fast! i really enjoyed seeing matt being a lawyer again instead of focusing on the vigilante aspect the whole time, like literally almost cheered when they won the court case as if i was there lol. can&#39;t wait for the rest of the show!
thoughts on invincible?
im gonna call it. this series is already way better than the other mcu shows, and yes its ways better than loki because im actually invested into daredevil born again.
lad, i&#39;mma be honest, you are cooking with these breakdowns üëçüèª, just a suggestion:- how about invincible? üòä<br>edit:- i didn&#39;t appreciate the &quot;out of the world&quot; pun lmfao, too soonüò≠ü§£
this was my favorite episode so that got me on board, i like the courtroom scenes i was so invested, i liked the white tiger and was hoping there were a few more scenes with him later on in the show, as the moment he suited up i was ready to see him do some superhero stuff, and then that moment it hurt i didn‚Äôt expect it at all. i‚Äôm hope we get the second iteration of wt hopefully soon. rip to kamar de los reyes i thought he did a great job for what screen time that he had.
really appreciate this fast upload, its been a while since you uploaded a review so fast‚úåÔ∏è
i really liked the actor playing white tiger... may he rest in peace
everything happens for the first time saying this because of your video title, btw really loved your videos.

white tiger. no action
despite having limited screen time, kamar de los reyes absolutely nailed white tiger!
